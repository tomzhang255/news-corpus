come this game was close and doubtful from Start to at the end of the first Hrolf the score was 2 to during the last part a foul was called on one of Pur players and Wellman succeeded in throwing the thus ending the game 3 to 2 for the boys game is one we dont care to dwell Long was 44 to 16 for the other our Alibi is that the floor was too Small for real open playing and that the court wan so Low that the usual Way of throwing a Basket was to bang the Ball against the Wellman being used to this Way had a great advantage Over besides the game was at least 113 too from this time on we Are going

clothes Many sizes too the game ended 9 to 7 for Grade from the the Cedar Falls although this was a National con Ference on consolidation it was poorly this was due to the fact that influenza prevails in Many sections of the nation and also due to the threatened railway there were three full Days of re ports and Good and some Bone a surprising thing was the fact that Many states Are far ahead of Iowa in the character of their Laws concerning consolidation and in the number of consolidated this state now Las 338 consolidated schools with this is an increase of about six a the thing of consolidation is Here for that governor Harding says that there will be no country schools in Ive there will Likely be country schools for Many More years than but there is nothing More certain than that consolidation is coming not in Iowa but in the whole one of the most interesting things about the meeting was the exhibit of work done in the consolidated it was probably the greatest of its kind in the United feet of floor space and included everything Montio Nable from hog feeders to Book Racks and from Wagon tongues to Many schools had Many photographs of their class rooms and school several of those exhibits required months of preparation and could be undertaken Only by schools with plenty of time and there is no question but that much Good comes from meetings of this brushing against other men in the same business and with the same problems is Worth much and listening to speakers from the far Corners of the country is a Little Edu cation in it is surprising to learn than Many schools in Iowa Are using motor busses for transportation and making the thing of the Road proposition will set the this but one thing is cer Tain and that is that consolidation and Good roads
