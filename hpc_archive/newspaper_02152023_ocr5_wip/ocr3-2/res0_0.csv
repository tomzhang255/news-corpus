Huh The reporter is five years old with this Issue While the past five years has been no bed of roses financially we have managed to get out the editions regularly and Hope to continue to give you a Good paper for Many years to come The daily joins with ore Miller in hoping that the reporter will live to a wipe old age. Although the paper is but five years of age it already has its wide sphere of influence and is one of the very Best weeklies coming to the daily a Exchange desk We Trust that the people of Tuscumbia and Gilbert county appreciate the reporter a they should and give it their uns tinted moral and financial support The weekly newspaper Are among the Best assets any county can have. British gunners have recently brought to Earth three of the i monster raiding zeppelins that participated in attacks on London The marksmanship shown by the protons is widely to result in fewer raids for admittedly the zeppelins can Hope to accomplish nothing More than to still fear into the hearts of enemy civilians Now that the moral effect 1b be ing produced by the High Angle guns it is not unlikely that Germans will cease their Midnight attacks for even the stout hearted Teutons canoe look Forward with an degree of pleasure to being incinerated in their giant balloons the death toll in Sundays raid was greater among the Able bodies fighting men of the Kaiser a April Fleet than it was among the women and children of London towns The Germans Are kicking because the allies Are using Quoth tank Quoth cars.

Doctor to the Church But whatever our individual opinions We have reason to give thanks unto god for the visible Church which has lived through the centuries It has not been always or even at any time such a representative of its head Jesus Christ As he would have it be but to that Church More than to any other organization or influence the world is debtor. It has added to the worlds wealth As has no other organization and on the lowest estimate of its Worth it has the right to the support of the people Compare material values in a Section where the Church influence has never been Felt with values in a country where the churches influence has bean potent where Ufa property and those other things we count of real value have the Protection of a Public sentiment the Church in its work done most to create the Church has claimed a share of the worlds wealth for its work but Over against the amounts that the agencies of sin Are taking from those who go in sins ways the Cost of the churches work is insignificant The saloon alone takes seven times As Many Don ears per capita As Doe the Church The Church a been the mighty Agency in the worlds Forward move ments towards better conditions for humanity in movements for moral reform and social Justice The churches representatives fought those cattle against the organized forces of evil and for moral reform when there were overwhelming Odds against them.

A a what Are the evidences of our membership in that body of which Christ is the head we prove our claim in that we Are in record with his plans and purposes and we have his spirit The Only business Christ has for his Church is that it do the work he earns to No. Those who Are his therefore will have 1 his vision of the great value of humanity the it Forth of souls humanity a great need of salvation 2 his Greffet i it in for the lost 3 his burden of soul for those who Are in bondage to sin and the Devil 4 his Faith that luit. city Home through him out of bondage into Liberty out of death into life 6 his spirit of service to the Oriu going out after those who Are God and giving ones self in service to chose By these tests we prove or right to claim membership in his for tale or rent modern a room cottage 201 wet third reel for rent 4-room apartment 206 Jackson it. 6-room cottage 700 second 6-Roonj House 164 Maple Htu e.
