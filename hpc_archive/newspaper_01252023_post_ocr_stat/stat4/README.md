hey Tom, we also need to get a sense of how much of our data includes non-words…

I propose the following:

for each year, sample about 200 documents, and create a data with the # of non-word errors.

My intuition is that the older documents should have more noise/non-words, because the quality of the scanned texts… we should not really see much error after, say, 1990s. what do you think?
